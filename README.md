# ChromocenterFeatures (SegmentCC, CurateCC, PlotCC)
Set of scripts to extract chromocenter features from fluorescence microscopy images of mouse cells.<br/>
The scripts have two associated external functions makeNucMask() and makeChromocenterMask() required for segmentation.<br/>

## What does this set of scripts do?
# SegmentCC
* segmentation of the nucleus
* segmentation of nuclear regions occupied by chromocenters (i.e. labeled with bound dCas9 or other markers)
* quantification of:
  * nucleus shape features and xy positions of nuclei within each image
  * chromocenter number & area
  * fluorescent signal intensities in chromocenters and the surrounding nucleoplasm
# CurateCC
* uses results from SegmentCC as input
* semi-automated workflow for visual inspection and curation of the data after segmentation
# PlotCC
* uses results from CurateCC as input
* exemplary routines to visualize and plot the features extracted from the images
# Outputs:
  * text file listing the positions (images) processed in each run 
  * text files listing the above-mentioned parameters for each cell
  * images of the created nuclear and chromocenter masks for visual inspection
  * exemplary boxplots as PDFs depicting chromocenter area and fold-enrichment of signals in chromocenters

## How is this script used?

### Requirements
* R version 3.6 or higher
* R packages:
  * [EBImage](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/EBImage.html) version 4.26

### Running the analysis on the test data set
* Install the listed requirements via [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/) (for [EBImage](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/EBImage.html))
* Download the functions [makeNucMask](https://github.com/RippeLab/ChromocenterFeatures/blob/main/makeNucMask.R), [makeChromocenterMask](https://github.com/RippeLab/ChromocenterFeatures/blob/main/makeChromocenterMask.R), the [example data](https://github.com/RippeLab/ChromocenterFeatures/blob/main/sample_data.zip) as well as the R scripts [SegmentCC.R](https://github.com/RippeLab/ChromocenterFeatures/blob/main/segmentCC.R), [CurateCC.R](https://github.com/RippeLab/ChromocenterFeatures/blob/main/curateCC.R) and [PlotCC.R](https://github.com/RippeLab/ChromocenterFeatures/blob/main/plotCC.R) into one folder on your local computer.
* Run the R script SegmentCC in R Studio 
* Open the R script CurateCC in R Studio, define the location of the SegmentCC results folder and run the script. Follow the instructions for inspecting and scoring the segmented images.
* Open the R script PlotCC in R Studio, define the location of the CurateCC results folder and run the script to generate exemplary plots.
