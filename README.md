# ChromocenterFeatures (SegmentCC, CurateCC, PlotCC)
Set of scripts to extract chromocenter features from fluorescence microscopy images of mouse cells.<br/>
The scripts have two associated external functions makeNucMask() and makeChromocenterMask() required for segmentation.<br/>

## What does this set of scripts do?
# SegmentCC
* segmentation of the nucleus
* segmentation of nuclear regions occupied by chromocenters (i.e. labeled with bound dCas9 or other markers)
* quantification of:
  * nucleus shape features and xy positions of nuclei within each image
  * chromocenter number & area
  * fluorescent signal intensities in chromocenters and the surrounding nucleoplasm
# CurateCC
* uses results from SegmentCC as input
* semi-automated workflow for visual inspection and curation of the data after segmentation
# PlotCC
* uses results from CurateCC as input
* exemplary routines to visualize and plot the features extracted from the images
# Outputs:
  * text file listing the positions (images) processed in each run 
  * text files listing the above-mentioned parameters for each cell
  * images of the created nuclear and chromocenter masks for visual inspection
  * fit parameters (only in R command line)
  * optional: an image with the created nuclear and aggregate masks for visual inspection (for each cell)

## How is this script used?

### Requirements
* R version 3.6 or higher
* R packages:
  * [EBImage](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/EBImage.html) version 4.26


### Running the analysis on the test data set
* Install the listed requirements via [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/) (for [EBImage](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/EBImage.html))
* Download the [functions](https://github.com/AnneRademacher/Optodroplets/tree/main/functions) and [example_data](https://github.com/AnneRademacher/Optodroplets/tree/main/example_data) folders as well as the R script [optodroplets_induction.R](https://github.com/AnneRademacher/Optodroplets/blob/main/optodroplets_induction.R) into one folder on your local computer (note that [example_data](https://github.com/AnneRademacher/Optodroplets/tree/main/example_data) is about 250 MB and contains the full data set from Fig. 4 of Rademacher *et al.* (2021) listed below)
* Run the R script [optodroplets_induction.R](https://github.com/AnneRademacher/Optodroplets/blob/main/optodroplets_induction.R) either in R Studio or from the R console using `source("optodroplets_induction.R")`
